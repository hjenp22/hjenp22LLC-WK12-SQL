# Homework-12 SQL: Employee Tracker
</div>

## Description 
This week's assignment presented an exciting opportunity to craft a sophisticated command-line application for efficiently managing a company's employee database. Leveraging the power of Node.js, alongside the latest update of Inquirer (version 8.2.4) and MySQL, I seamlessly integrated these technologies to create a user-friendly interface. This seamless integration empowers users to effortlessly interact with and manipulate crucial company information stored within the database. The result is a robust, streamlined solution that enhances the overall management and accessibility of the company's data.
